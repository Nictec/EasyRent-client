##About 

Easyrent is a equipment management system for bands and rental companies. It is based on Django, Django REST Framework and vue.js. The project is usable but far from finished. Feel free to download and test it and if you have any ideas or feature requests please let me know. 

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# lint all *.js and *.vue files
npm run lint

```
